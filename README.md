## How to use
I included a .bat file in the folder. Just open the .bat file and the program should run.

It will open at a mainscene which has 3 options: "open file","new file" and "exit" 

when "open file" is clicked you are propmted to search for a file specifically a excel file and you open it and it will lead you to the data entry tab. Once you are there you can enter some data on what you did and hit the save button. Another option is pressing the "analytics" button and it will open some graphs based on data entered. i didnt include all the graphs just because i wanted something working for my presentation since stuff just seems to work one second and the next it doesnt.



## Purpose of project 
This project is for CSI 2300 and was presented 4/11/2024. 
The intended purpose of me working alone was for me to learn how to do pretty much everything by myself since I am a beginner in java.
So i thought it would be interesting to make a workout tracker just for personal use, it is simple but I figured it could make things a little cooler since its something i made. 

I learned a lot from the project and am happy with what I arrived at even though it isnt much. I got something out of the class and that I am happy with. I can now make simple applications using java and javafx in conjunction with scene builder.
